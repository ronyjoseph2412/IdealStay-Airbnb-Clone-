<br>    <h1>A day to Delphi Oracle & Parnassus.</h1>
    <p class="lead"> <br>We will start from the center of Athens and take about 2 hours to reach the Delphi oracle. On our way, we will pass important points of interest: Battlefield of Plataea and Marathon, the place where Oedipus met and killed his father, according to legend and great ancient cities such as Thebes and Thespies. After our visit to the archaeological site of Delphi and the museum, we will eat at an amazing restaurant in the village of Delphi, overlooking the Delphi valley and their ancient harbor.
Afterwards we will head higher up Mount Parnassos (1350 meters) and pass through beautiful mountain peaks. There is the Korikeion Andron, the Pan Cave and the first oracle in the area. Going down the other side of the mountain, we will visit the ancient city of Lilia, where the source of the river Kifissos (one of the two rivers of ancient Athens) is located. There are also 2 ancient temples (Apollo and Artemis), and there are also strange signs of the Knight Templars.
Our final destination will be the battlefield of the 300 Spartans and King Leonidas against the Persians. The place that became one of the most important battles in World History.
Other things to note
Delphi Oracle is mostly uphills and rocks!
