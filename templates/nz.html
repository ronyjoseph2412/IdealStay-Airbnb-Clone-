  <br>  <h1>Sheep Farm Tour & hand-spun Woolly hat.</h1>
<br>    <p class="lead">When you arrive o on our beautiful farm and meet our friendly, naturally coloured Corriedale sheep & lambs. Followed by an explanation of how wool is shorn from the sheep, skirted, washed & dried. Next, guests will select their choice of wool, alpaca, lama and other fibres to card into large batts of fibre that are ready to process by spinning them into wool.
After a spinning demonstration, guests will be able to practise spinning the fibre into their own ball of wool to take with them. If time allows they can try knitting or weaving and have a short walk around the farm to meet the other animals. This experience is suitable for beginners with no previous experience needed. Children can attend, just advise the age of the child, as I'll organise a child friendly wool activity for them.
I'd like to make sure you have fun, relaxing & unique experience that you will always remember. The scenery is spectacular and I am happy to take photos of you around the farm and with the animals.
You can even select your own farm made hat as a free souvenir. Each hat is handcrafted, organically processed and shorn from our own sheeps wool, hand made and over 20 hours of work in each one. Come and learn how your hat was crafted - eco -slow fashion just for you.

Another consideration would be Lake Taupo in the central North Island..</p>
